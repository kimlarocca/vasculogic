                <h4>Device Performance</h4>
                <p><strong>In Vitro Phantom Studies</strong></p>
<p>Early studies of the prototype's cannulation accuracy utilized a Nasco© Advanced Phlebotomy Training Arm. In 270 trials, the device demonstrated 100% first-stick accuracy and mean completion time of 30 sec (hyperlink to paper). One major goal of in vitro evaluation was to accurately simulate the human variability of a full clinical trial. Because commercial arm models are insufficient for this, VascuLogic has developed patent-protected methods for manufacturing customized phantoms that accurately model the optical and mechanical properties of human skin tissue. The phantoms comprise multiple skin tissue layers and include surrogate veins carrying blood. The phantoms are able to simulate a wide demographic range of skin tone, age, body mass index, vein diameter, and hematocrit. Evaluating VenousPro™ on 288 different phantoms, the device demonstrated 98% first-stick accuracy and a 35 sec mean completion time (hyperlink to paper).</p>
<p><strong>In Vivo Rat Injection Studies</strong></p>
<p>The accuracy and speed of the VenousPro™ device in cannulating peripheral veins and drawing blood has been recently tested in adult Sprague Dawley rat tail veins, which have been shown to closely mimic the optical and mechanical properties of human pediatric peripheral veins. The study demonstrated that the VenousPro™ was able to accurately insert a cannula with 100% first-stick success (hyperlink to paper). VenousPro™ additionally demonstrated a mean time to completion 1.5 minutes on the animal models. No occurrences of extravasation, needle dislodgement, loss of patency, or other complications were observed in the animals after cannulation.</p>
<p><strong>Adult Human Imaging Studies</strong></p>
<p>The VenousPro™ prototype's optical imaging capability has been compared to that of a trained clinician in an IRB study at Rutgers University. The study enrolled a sample of 101 volunteers that covered a broad range in age, ethnicity, and body mass index. In 99 of 101 patients, the VenousPro™ was able to detect at least one major vein in the forearm, elbow, or wrist (hyperlink to paper). The device provided significant improvements in vein contrast compared to visualization by the naked eye.</p>
<p><strong>First-in-Human Studies</strong></p>
<p>A clinical protocol has been approved for first-in-human evaluation of the automated venipuncture device. The study is targeted to begin in May 2015.</p>

                <h4>Technology</h4>
                <p><strong>Combined Infrared and Ultrasound Vein Imaging</strong></p>
<p>The device uses infrared light to improve the contrast of subcutaneous peripheral veins, and precisely extracts the 3D position of the veins. Suitable veins are displayed on the device’s user interface, from which the clinician can select the final cannulation site. Then the ultrasound probe lowers down on the patient’s arm to provide a high-resolution magnification of the chosen vein, and confirm venous blood flow. Finally, the robot aligns the cannula along the direction of the vein, and inserts the needle into the center of the vessel.</p>
<p><strong>3D Vessel Reconstruction</strong></p>
<p>The combined use of infrared and ultrasound imaging allows a 3D map of the patient’s veins to be reconstructed in real time. The ability to precisely determine the depth of the vessels represents a key advantage of the VenousPro™ technology over traditional visualization methods, which provide only a 2D view. By locating the 3D position of peripheral veins in real time, VenousPro™ is able to perform the needle cannulation routine with sub-millimeter accuracy.</p>
<p><strong>Smart Guidance Systems</strong></p>
<p>To select a suitable vein for cannulation, clinicians rely on complex deductive reasoning of multiple factors (vein depth, anatomical knowledge, past medical history, etc.). The key step of this decision process is to correctly identify the major peripheral veins. In order to deliver image recognition and knowledge representation comparable to that of an experienced clinician, VenousPro™ implements a Smart Guidance System that deduces high-level image information to recognize, label and assess the suitability of forearm and elbow veins. In this way, the VenousPro™ is able to 1) increase the accuracy and stability of needle guidance; 2) provide reliable decision support as a means to reduce clinical complexity; and 3) enable autonomous vein cannulation with minimal human intervention.</p>
<p><strong>Miniaturized Robotics</strong></p>
<p>The robotic system is comprised of a 3-DOF Cartesian gantry and a 4-DOF serial needle manipulator arm. Precision lead-screw linear stages are used for the Cartesian positioning, whereas DC servo motors, are used for the 4-DOF serial arm. The serial arm provides alignment along the direction of the vein, positions the needle at the desired insertion angle, and performs the injection using a linear spindle drive. Through rigorous engineering testing, we have achieved needle tip positioning accuracies of 0.21±0.02 mm across the full workspace of a standard venipuncture procedure. We have also implemented an automated needle handling system to limit practitioner contact with exposed sharps, in order to reduce the risk of accidental needle sticks. The design consists of an electromagnet embedded in the robotic end-effector, so the robot can easily and quickly grab the needle to begin the procedure, and release it in a sharps container after the venipuncture. The engineering team at VascuLogic is currently developing an automated blood vial handling system for blood draws and an intravenous fluid delivery system for IV procedures as well.</p>
<p><strong>User Interface</strong></p>
<p>The VenousProTM user interface is simple, intuitive, and can be learned with minimal training. The user interface allows the infrared and ultrasound images to be displayed in real time with high resolution, while walking the patient and practitioner through the procedure.</p>
